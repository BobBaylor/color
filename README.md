# color
## What is this?
This python script proportionally but randomly places color tiles in an image to simulate a custom mix of colors.
## Why would I want to do this?
If you want to order a custom mix of tiles for, say, a back splash or the front of a piece of furniture, then you might want to see  how the mix will look and, perhaps, how you might want to change the proportions.
## How do I run this script?
Unless you want to use the same tiles that I did, your first task will be scanning the tiles you want to work with. Then,
put the file names of the scans into the script at around line 77. 
## Will this work for any set of tiles?
This script makes assumptions about the tiles, such as all being about the same height. It also assumes that tiles
will be cut down to random lengths.
